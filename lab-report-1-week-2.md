2. Remotely Connecting <br/>
Use VSCode to connect the client to the remote server (in this case ieng6). For Windows, you need to first install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) to that you are able to connect remotely. Next, look up your course account using [UCSD Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and reset the password if needed.
